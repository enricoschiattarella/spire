# Server plugin: NodeAttestor "aws_iid"

*Must be used in conjunction with the agent-side aws_iid plugin*

The `aws_iid` plugin automatically attests instances using the AWS Instance
Metadata API and the AWS Instance Identity document. It also allows an operator
to use AWS Instance IDs when defining SPIFFE ID attestation policies. Agents
attested by the aws_iid attestor will be issued a SPIFFE ID like
`spiffe://example.org/agent/aws_iid/ACCOUNT_ID/REGION/INSTANCE_ID`

| Configuration       | Description | Default                 |
| --------------------| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `trust_domain`      | The trust domain that the agent belongs to |  |
| `access_key_id`     | AWS access key id     | Value of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable |
| `secret_access_key` | AWS secret access key | Value of `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable |
| `skip_block_device` | Skip anti-tampering mechanism which checks to make sure that the underlying root volume has not been detached prior to attestation. | false |

The user or role identified by the credentials must have permissions for `ec2:DescribeInstances`.
